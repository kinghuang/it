On March 2, 2015, the Chief Information Officer at the University of Calgary resigned, continuing Information Technology's revolving door problem. Since 2009, CIOs—both interim and permanent—have flowed through the unit at a regular pace. The most recent CIO to resign made a point in town hall meetings of committing to the position beyond the typical 18-month life span, a goal he would fail to achieve.

The ephemeral nature of university IT leadership is a troubling issue. In the past six years, there have been three overhauls of the department, including the creation and destruction of entire directorates. Constant change in leadership results in vision without execution, as commitments to strategies dissolve when leaders resign or are abruptly removed.

In a Gartner survey of higher education CIOs, the [mean tenure was found to be seven and one-half years](http://www.gartner.com/document/589708), far above the average of ?? months at the University of Calgary. The survey also found that “more-research-intensive institutions have slightly longer-tenured CIOs” and the standing 1990s joke of ‘CIO’ meaning ‘Career Is Over’ is not true today in higher education. The contrast with the University of Calgary is stark.

The CIO challenge at the University of Calgary resemble issues with CIOs in the United States federal government. A 2011 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found the [typical tenure at the CIO position at less than 2 years](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-634). In an interview with CIO Journal, Van Hitch—former CIO at the U.S. Department of Justice—[postulated on some of the reasons for this and its impacts](http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/04/22/federal-cios-leaving-so-soon/).

    **Why do so many agency CIOs want to leave their jobs after such a short period of time?**

    **Hitch**: It’s a very difficult job, and in many ways, a thankless one. I often equate it to running at sprint speed for an entire marathon. Crises arise every day. To keep progress moving on longer term policies and strategic initiatives, agency CIOs must run at peak speed and never slow down.

    **How does this CIO revolving door affect agency IT operations and initiatives?**

    The cost in terms of morale and efficiency can be significant. Leadership changes in any organization can affect productivity. In the absence of strong leadership and clear objectives, employees begin worrying about job security, strategic initiatives lose momentum, and basically everything is put on hold until the new leader is in place. When this happens every two years, the result can be a permanent—and costly—state of bureaucratic inertia. Today, the federal government spends roughly $80 billion annually on IT. I estimate that if agencies could keep strong leaders in place and employees focused and productive, the government could likely save 15 percent of its annual IT outlay, which could then be reinvested in mission-enhancing initiatives.
