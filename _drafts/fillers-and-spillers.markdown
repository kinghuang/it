title: "Fillers & Spillers"
---

Johnathan “Wolf” Rentzsch talked about “[Fillers & Spillers](https://vimeo.com/80646309)” at Çingleton 3 in Montréal. The theme of this particular instance of the conference was *Core Values*, “[that which we keep constant amidst change](https://web.archive.org/web/20130817113219/http://cingleton.com/).” Jonathan’s take on the theme related to his dismay at the development communities' lack of resistance to Section 3.3.1 of the iOS Program License Agreement in 2010, which mandated that iOS apps be “originally written” in C/C++/Objective-C. 

While benign at first sight, and arguably logical in the interest of platform coherence and stability, the biggest impact of this new clause in the agreement was clear: Adobe Flash. iOS applications that were simply wrappers around Flash would be banned from the App Store.
