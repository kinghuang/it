title: "Fillers & Spillers"
---

Johnathan “Wolf” Rentzsch talked about [*Fillers & Spillers*](https://vimeo.com/80646309)” at Çingleton 3 (2013) in Montréal, an indie conference for developers. The theme of Çingleton 3 was *Core Values*, “[that which we keep constant amidst change](https://web.archive.org/web/20130817113219/http://cingleton.com/).” Rentzsch’s take on the theme relates to his disappointment at the development community's lack of resistance to the devisive issue of Section 3.3.1 of the iOS Program License Agreement in April 2010. Apple mandated that iOS apps be “originally written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript,” [effectively banning Adobe Flash based apps](http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/iphone_agreement_bans_flash_compiler) from the App Store.

Apple's intentions and merits in changing §3.3.1 generated much debate between those that saw Apple as a ruthless corporation trampling on the freedom of developers, and those that saw pragmatism in avoiding a situation such as the [North American video game crash of 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983) by preserving the quality and integrity of the iOS platform. In his Çingleton talk, four years after the fact, Rentzsch looked back at the issue from a very different perspective, that of the roles of *fillers* and *spillers* in human technological development.

Rentzsch argues that all of humanity's progress hinges on technology, and that technology has enriched humanity to the point where we can be nice to many strangers. Beyond just our immediate family or tribe, we can afford to be nice to people we don't know or don't particularly care about. Progress is made as a result of less resource contention and greater levels of education leading to an informed populace. Collectively, humankind contributes to shared pools of technology, each with their own shared knowledge, tools, and networks of people. And, in these pools, are two types of actors.

**Fillers** contribute to a shared technological pool. They occupying their own bubble and become insular as the field builds its own vocabularies and cliques. For fillers, pushing the human race forward means to discover and invent.

**Spillers** are enthusiastic about their field. Like the Greek Titan Prometheus who [gifted mankind with fire stolen from Mount Olympus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus), they seek to share the pool's bounty with the masses in the form of knowledge and artifacts. Spillers are catalysts connecting pools with the rest of humankind. But, they are not the foundation.

Rentzsch proposes that Apple operates as both a filler and spiller, but primarily as a spiller. That position fits well with an oft raised trope that [*Apple never invents anything*](http://bgr.com/2012/09/11/apple-criticism-ipad-iphone-gassee/).” Given the enormity of Apple as a spiller and the fact that spillers are meant to be visible to and understood by the general population outside of a bubble, it is understandable that such a perception exists. As a spiller, being enthusiastic about its field and wanting to protect its integrity to its consumer audience against a potentially disruptive external force is logical. That it came at a cost to its developer audience in its much smaller filler role is a balance Apple has evidently achieved.

## Is IT a Filler or Spiller?

The concept of fillers and spillers is very useful in examining the role of IT in higher education institutions. It can be difficult to recognize the existence of the two roles, whether internally as part of the organizational structure or externally in the audiences that IT serves, leading to imbalances between the two, or even worse, a complete absence of one. This leads to challenges in fulfilling seemingly simple customer requests and in communicating the value of IT to leadership due to differences between the two types.



On the University of Calgary IT website, the following tagline [appears under Information Technologies](http://www.ucalgary.ca/it/).

    Delivering technology solutions through effective, sustainable and responsible planning and design

Similarly, this is the stated [IT mission](http://www.ucalgary.ca/it/about).

    We enable learning, leading research and supporting services for our university community by leveraging information technologies and protecting information assets. As a trusted leader, we deliver technology solutions through effective, sustainable and responsible planning and design. We focus on being service oriented, responsive, innovative and collaborative.

Notice the emphasis on *delivering solutions* in both statements. Now, consider the structure of the IT organization, implemented in January 2015.

(insert simplified org chart here)

IT at the University of Calgary is structured as a spiller only. No part of the organization is designed to support a filler role, for both internal and external audiences.
