title: "Fillers & Spillers"
---

Johnathan “Wolf” Rentzsch talked about [*Fillers & Spillers*](https://vimeo.com/80646309)” at Çingleton 3 (2013) in Montréal. The theme of Çingleton 3 was *Core Values*, “[that which we keep constant amidst change](https://web.archive.org/web/20130817113219/http://cingleton.com/).” Rentzsch’s take on the theme related to his disappointment at the development communities' lack of resistance to Section 3.3.1 of the iOS Program License Agreement in 2010, which mandated that iOS apps be originally written in C, C++, or Objective-C. 

While seemingly benign for iPhone users, and perhaps logical in the interest of platform coherence and user experience, the primary target of this clause in the agreement was clear: Adobe Flash. iOS applications that were thin wrappers around existing Flash-based content would be banned from the App Store. At the time, Flash-based games were common on the web and many had  been wrapped for delivery on the App Store with little native integration.

Rentzsch argues that “[Section 3.3.1 makes developers wholly reliant on Apple for software engineering innovation.](http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/592949476/c4-release)” That, limiting the choices developers have stunts foundational progress, and the process of discovery and invention. However, as John Gruber discussses in [*Why Apple Changed Section 3.3.1*](http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/why_apple_changed_section_331), the change can be to the favour of iPhone users. Cross-platform toolkits such as Adobe Flash and MonoTouch “have never—ever—produced top-notch native apps for Apple platforms,” and, “such apps generally have been downright crummy.”

## Human Progress

It is easy to view the situation as simply a ruthless entity (Apple) trampling on the freedom of developers to thwart a competitor (Adobe) for its own profit. Fives years later, we can see Apple with a staggering 92% profit share of the smartphone industry while Adobe Flash has virtually no presence on the iOS platform. However, Rentzsch examines the problem from a much broader viewpoint: the intertwining relationship between human progress and technology.

Rentzsch argues that technology has enriched humanity to the point where we can be ’nice’ to many strangers, not just to our immediate family or our tribe. Technology has unlocked vast amount of resources, leading to less resource contention and a more informed populace through greater education. 
Collectively, humankind contributes to shared pools of technology, each with their own shared knowledge, tools, and networks of people. And, in these pools, are two types of people.

**Fillers** contribute to a shared technological pool. They occupying their own bubble and become insular as the field builds its own vocabularies and cliques. For fillers, pushing the human race forward means to discover and invent.

**Spillers** are enthusiastic about their field. Like the Greek Titan Prometheus who [gifted mankind with fire stolen from Mount Olympus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus), they seek to share the pool's bounty with the masses in the form of knowledge and artifacts. Spillers are catalysts connecting pools with the rest of humankind. But, they are not the foundation.

Rentzsch proposes that Apple operates as both a filler and spiller, but primarily as a spiller. That position fits well with an oft raised trope that [*Apple never invents anything*](http://bgr.com/2012/09/11/apple-criticism-ipad-iphone-gassee/).” Given the enormity of Apple as a spiller and the fact that spillers are meant to be visible to and understood by the general population outside of a bubble, it is understandable that such a perception exists. As a spiller, being enthusiastic about its field and wanting to protect its integrity to its consumer audience against a potentially disruptive external force is logical. That it came at a cost to its developer audience in its much smaller filler role is a balance Apple has evidently achieved.

## Is IT a Filler or Spiller?

The concept of fillers and spillers is very useful in examining the role of IT in a higher education institution. Who is the audience, or *are* the audiences, that IT services? What does it mean for IT to be a filler versus a spiller? Is the value of IT measured based on *potentials* or *actuals*?
