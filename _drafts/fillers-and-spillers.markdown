title: "Fillers & Spillers"
---

Johnathan “Wolf” Rentzsch talked about [*Fillers & Spillers*](https://vimeo.com/80646309)” at Çingleton 3 (2013) in Montréal. The theme of Çingleton 3 was *Core Values*, “[that which we keep constant amidst change](https://web.archive.org/web/20130817113219/http://cingleton.com/).” Rentzsch’s take on the theme related to his disappointment at the development communities' lack of resistance to Section 3.3.1 of the iOS Program License Agreement in 2010, which mandated that iOS apps be originally written in C, C++, or Objective-C. 

While seemingly benign for iPhone users, and perhaps logical in the interest of platform coherence and user experience, the primary target of this clause in the agreement was clear: Adobe Flash. iOS applications that were thin wrappers around existing Flash-based content would be banned from the App Store. At the time, Flash-based games were common on the web and many had  been wrapped for delivery on the App Store with little native integration.

Rentzsch argues that “[Section 3.3.1 makes developers wholly reliant on Apple for software engineering innovation.](http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/592949476/c4-release)” That, limiting the choices developers have stunts foundational progress, and the process of discovery and invention. However, as John Gruber discussses in [*Why Apple Changed Section 3.3.1*](http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/why_apple_changed_section_331), the change can be to the favour of iPhone users. Cross-platform toolkits such as Adobe Flash and MonoTouch “have never—ever—produced top-notch native apps for Apple platforms,” and, “such apps generally have been downright crummy.”
